# cosyvoice-win-jobs

Minimal polling jobs server for **CosyVoice2/CosyVoice3** on a Windows host.

This repo is deliberately narrow. It is meant for one job:

- stable long-form voice cloning for audiobook-style pipelines
- Windows-hosted deployment
- shared local voice references
- async jobs API with polling
- OpenAI-style direct speech endpoint with optional streaming

The key design choice is different from the Qwen experiment:

- do **not** recompute the speaker embedding for every request when possible
- build a cached `zero_shot_spk_id` once
- reuse that cached speaker across requests for better timbre consistency

That mirrors the official CosyVoice2 examples, where a zero-shot speaker can be added once and reused later.

## Why this repo exists

For audiobook work, per-request quality is not enough. We also need:

- consistent timbre from chunk to chunk
- predictable async jobs
- an API that a separate orchestrator can poll

Official CosyVoice already provides the core inference logic and an official FastAPI runtime. This wrapper keeps the official inference path, but adds a simpler Windows-hosted jobs interface inspired by `xtts-win-jobs`.

## Official CosyVoice notes that shaped this wrapper

According to the official CosyVoice repo:

- CosyVoice 2 supports Russian
- CosyVoice 2 supports zero-shot and cross-lingual voice cloning
- CosyVoice provides FastAPI and gRPC deployment examples
- the official examples show saving a zero-shot speaker and reusing it later with `zero_shot_spk_id`
- the official examples also note that for CosyVoice2 demo-style output you may want `text_frontend=False`

For this reason this wrapper defaults to:

- `mode=zero_shot`
- `text_frontend=false`
- `speed=1.0`
- voice cache reuse by `voice`

## Recommendation for your hardware

For a Windows machine with **RTX 3070 Ti 8GB**, the most realistic first deployment is:

- Windows host
- WSL2 Ubuntu recommended for the actual model runtime
- `Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B` for Russian audiobook work
- `CosyVoice2-0.5B` as the older fallback
- `fp16=true`
- `load_vllm=false`
- `load_trt=false`
- `load_jit=false`

Native Windows may work, but I would treat it as the experimental path. WSL2 is the safer operational target.

Current native Windows smoke status:

- tested with local Miniforge under `.conda/miniforge`
- tested with `FunAudioLLM/CosyVoice2-0.5B`
- tested with `FunAudioLLM/Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B`
- tested with CUDA on RTX 3070 Ti
- CLI zero-shot synthesis works with UTF-8 Russian text files
- polling jobs API works on `127.0.0.1:8040`

## Features

- polling jobs API: `POST /v1/tts/jobs`, `GET /v1/tts/jobs/{id}`, `GET /v1/tts/jobs/{id}/audio`
- direct OpenAI-style API: `POST /v1/audio/speech`
- shared voice discovery from `shared/`
- sidecar prompt text discovery for zero-shot cloning
- zero-shot speaker caching by `voice` id
- persisted job metadata under `.data/jobs/`
- persisted voice metadata under `.data/voices/`
- simple local CLI for direct synthesis

## Shared voice layout

Put reference bundles into `shared/` like this:

- `reference_long.wav`
- `reference_long.txt`

Or:

- `anna_take2.flac`
- `anna_take2.txt`

When you submit a job with `"voice": "reference_long"`, the server will:

1. find the newest matching audio file
2. find the matching sidecar text
3. create or refresh the zero-shot speaker cache
4. synthesize future chunks using the cached speaker id

That cache-first behavior is the main quality lever for chunk-to-chunk consistency.

## API

### Create job

```json
POST /v1/tts/jobs
{
  "input": "Это тестовая фраза.",
  "model": "Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B",
  "voice": "reference_long",
  "response_format": "wav",
  "mode": "zero_shot",
  "text_frontend": false,
  "fix_question_intonation": true,
  "speed": 1.0
}
```

### Create job with uploaded reference

```json
POST /v1/tts/jobs
{
  "input": "Это тестовая фраза.",
  "model": "Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B",
  "voice": "reference_long",
  "response_format": "wav",
  "mode": "zero_shot",
  "text_frontend": false,
  "fix_question_intonation": true,
  "speed": 1.0,
  "reference_audio_base64": "<base64-or-data-uri>",
  "reference_audio_filename": "reference.wav",
  "reference_text": "Точный текст референса."
}
```

### Direct OpenAI-style speech

```json
POST /v1/audio/speech
{
  "input": "Это тестовая фраза.",
  "model": "Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B",
  "voice": "reference_long",
  "response_format": "wav",
  "mode": "zero_shot",
  "text_frontend": false,
  "fix_question_intonation": true,
  "speed": 1.0
}
```

This endpoint returns audio bytes directly. It supports:

- `response_format="wav"` for regular clients
- `response_format="pcm"` for raw signed 16-bit PCM
- `stream=true` for chunked transfer as CosyVoice yields audio segments

The polling jobs API still only stores and returns WAV files.

Question-ending texts have one extra wrapper rule by default:

- `fix_question_intonation=true`
- if a `zero_shot` request ends with `?` or `?"` or similar closing quotes/brackets after `?`
- the wrapper auto-promotes that request to `instruct2`
- and injects a hidden instruction telling CosyVoice to read the target text with question intonation

This is meant to compensate for CosyVoice often under-playing question marks in long-form reading.

Send `"fix_question_intonation": false` if you want to disable that behavior for a specific request.

### Poll status

```cmd
curl http://127.0.0.1:8040/v1/tts/jobs/<job_id>
```

### Download audio

```cmd
curl http://127.0.0.1:8040/v1/tts/jobs/<job_id>/audio --output result.wav
```

## epub_to_audiobook integration

This project is intentionally compatible with the polling style already used in `epub_to_audiobook`.

Typical settings on that side would look like:

```ini
[tts]
tts = openai
voice_name = reference_long
output_format = wav
model_name = Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B
speed = 1.0

[tts.openai]
openai_base_url = http://desktop-6l3hnor.local:8040
openai_enable_polling = true
openai_submit_url = /v1/tts/jobs
openai_status_url_template = /v1/tts/jobs/{job_id}
openai_download_url_template = /v1/tts/jobs/{job_id}/audio
openai_job_id_path = id
openai_job_status_path = status
openai_poll_interval = 5
openai_poll_timeout = 14400
openai_submit_omit_fields = instructions
openai_submit_extra_fields = {"mode":"zero_shot","text_frontend":false,"fix_question_intonation":true}
```

If the voice cache already exists on the server, `voice_name` alone is enough. If not, you first seed the cache with a shared `voice.wav + voice.txt` pair or a request that includes uploaded reference audio and `reference_text`.

For CosyVoice3 the wrapper automatically adds the required `<|endofprompt|>` marker to prompt/instruction text before calling the official runtime.

If you send `instructions`, the wrapper auto-promotes a `zero_shot` request to `instruct2` so the instruction stays separate from the spoken `input`.

## Installation idea

This wrapper expects the official CosyVoice codebase to be available under `vendor/CosyVoice/`.

The included bootstrap script is designed to:

1. clone the official repo
2. create a dedicated conda env with Python 3.10
3. install official CosyVoice requirements
4. install this wrapper in editable mode

On Windows the wrapper scripts first look for a repo-local conda executable at `.conda/miniforge/Scripts/conda.exe`, then fall back to `conda` from `PATH`.

If ModelScope downloads fail because of local SSL certificates, downloading from Hugging Face is a valid fallback:

- `FunAudioLLM/Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B` into `pretrained_models/Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B`
- `FunAudioLLM/CosyVoice2-0.5B` into `pretrained_models/CosyVoice2-0.5B`

Model weights are not committed. Put them under:

- `pretrained_models/Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B`
- `pretrained_models/CosyVoice2-0.5B`

## Quick Start

```cmd
scripts\bootstrap_windows.cmd
cosyvoice-win-server.cmd --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8040 --model-id Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B --model-dir pretrained_models\Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B
```

Then place a reference bundle into `shared/` and submit a job.

For Russian CLI smoke tests, prefer `--file` with a UTF-8 text file instead of inline Cyrillic through `cmd.exe`:

```cmd
cosyvoice-win.cmd --file input\ru_smoke.txt ru_smoke.wav reference_dictor_short --overwrite
```

## Caveats

- This wrapper does not try to be a universal OpenAI TTS clone.
- `response_format` is currently `wav` only.
- `mode=zero_shot` is the primary path for audiobook use.
- `cross_lingual` is supported as an alternative mode.
- `instruct2` is intentionally not wired in this first version because cached-speaker reuse around instruct mode is less predictable than zero-shot reuse.
